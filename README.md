Assistant Quick Settings Tile
=============================

## Launch your default assist app from the notification shade

This app provides an alternative way to launch the assistant on devices with no home button to long-press or with navigation bar gesture removed (like Galaxy S25 series).

It has no launcher icon, you have to add it to your Quick Settings tiles. Look for the pencil icon in the notification shade. You also need to set a default assist app in your device settings.
